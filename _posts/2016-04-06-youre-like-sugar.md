# You're like sugar. 

Overeating two packets of Salted Caramel Zumbo Tim-Tams,

one packet of Caramel Crowns,

sickly sweet treats from Japan - 

that I didn't NEED to consume - 

all because...

There will only EVER be

a ship-in-the-night scenario

between you & I.

And I say I'm 'mindful'.

Holy crap!

Now THAT's awareness.

Of where I am now,

and how I want to move through

the fire of transformation - 

to be free, 

from the shackles of 

attachment & sexual desire

and liberated

in my truth of compassion.

The seed is planted,

being watered,

and how will I harvest my crop?

THAT is the question I ask.
