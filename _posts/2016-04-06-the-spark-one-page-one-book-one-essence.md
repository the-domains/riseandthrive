**The spark: One page. One book. One essence.**

**The Hsin Hsin Ming**

(Verses
on the Faith Mind) by Chien-chih Seng-ts'an Third Zen Patriarch \[606AD\] Translated
by Robert B Clarke

"The Great Way is not difficult

for those who have no preferences

When love and hate are both absent

everything becomes clear and undisguised

Make the smallest distinction however,

and heaven and earth are set infinitely
apart.

If you wish to see the truth

then hold no opinions for or against
anything.

To set up what you like against what you
dislike

is the disease of the mind.

When the deep meaning of things is not
understood

the mind's essential peace is disturbed
to no avail.

The Way is perfect like vast space

where nothing is lacking and nothing is
in excess.

Indeed, it is due to our choosing to
accept or reject

that we do not see the true nature of
things.

Live neither in the entanglements of
outer things

nor in the inner feelings of emptiness

Be serene in the oneness of things

and
such erroneous views will disappear by themselves."
