****

Every great story starts with context. 

A
beginning, a catalyst and the spark of creation. A journey towards authenticity was always
in the field of my energy. However a deepening of this energy needed to occur
in order for the light of The Way to shine in my heart.

A warm glow infused my soul the moment I
lay eyes on you. The moment was Saturday 22 February 2014, and it would
only be three months' after this time that I would come to understand the true
meaning of living authentically.

And for this very reason I am eternally
grateful.
