From darkness to light, the journey ultimately began on 11th July 1999\.

I lived a desolate life in inner-western Melbourne, working, feeding a habit & living minute to minute.

A shocking existence, which I knew was fraught with immense danger the moment I took said 'yes'.

And there are so many blessings in this darkness.

So many miracles.

I wanted to kill myself.

But I didn't.

I wanted to be free.

So I reached out for support. And received the love & nourishment that was necessary in order for me to rehabilitate.

That darkness is a blessing.

Because now I know that there can only EVER be light in my life.

Healing is the journey that unfolded, officially anchoring in 2001\.

I hold immense gratitude for the journey from darkness to light.
